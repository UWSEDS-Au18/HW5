# HW5: Project functional and component specifications.

This homework is done as a group with your project team.

You will create two documents describing the design of your project. These documents should be in your project ``docs`` folder.
- **Functional Specification**. The document should have the following sections:
  - Background. The problem being addressed.
  - User profile. Who uses the system. What they know about the domain and computing (e.g., can browse the web, can program in Python)
  - Data sources. What data you will use and how it is structured.
  - Use cases. Describing at least two use cases. For each, describe: (a) the objective of the user interaction (e.g., withdraw money from an ATM); and (b) the expected interactions between the user and your system.
  
- **Component Specification**. The document should have sections for.
  - Software components. High level description of the software components such as: *data manager*, which provides a simplified interface to your data and provides application specific features (e.g., querying data subsets); and *visualization manager*, which displays data frames as a plot. Describe at least 3 components specifying: what it does, inputs it requires, and outputs it provides.
  - Interactions to accomplish use cases. Describe how the above software components interact to accomplish at least one of your use cases.
  - Preliminary plan. A list of tasks in priority order.
  
 **Grading Rubric**. Between the two documents, there are 7 sections. You will receive up to one point for each section. We expect more detail in the Functional Specification than in the Component Specification. Both specifications are expected to be living documents that you update as your project progresses.
